# WorkdayScheduler

## Description

I was primarily motivated by the fact that I wanted to build more complex application to run from a web browser.I built this project to have a better idea
of what it takes to develop a web application. It solves the issue of being able to organize your day from a web browser. I learned how to use bootstrap and jquery along with some javascript implementation.
